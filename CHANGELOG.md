## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-06

First public release of the Oh My Pi port.

### Added
- `provider.contextWindow` setting with three modes:
  - `"auto"` (default) — per-model context policy based on measured SDK behavior.
  - `"1m"` — force the 1M context window; only 1M-capable models are registered.
  - `"200k"` — force the 200K context window; only 200K-capable models are registered.
- Models without a runtime for the selected forced window are hidden from the
  model picker instead of being misreported.
- `thinkingLevelMap` fallback so Sonnet 5 / Sonnet 4.6 expose `xhigh` (mapped to `max`).

### Changed
- Ported from Pi (`@earendil-works/*`) to Oh My Pi (`@oh-my-pi/*`): extension
  manifest (`omp.extensions`), provider registration, message conversion, and
  config directory resolution (`~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.json`).
- Corrected the `claude-fable-5` context policy: the bare `claude-fable-5`
  runtime serves 200K (verified), while `claude-fable-5[1m]` serves 1M. In
  `"auto"` mode Fable 5 now registers at 200K.
